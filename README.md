#t.co bypass

Fairly self explanatory, but just in case, this package will replace t.co URLs on Twitter and Tweetdeck by using other attributes in the anchor tag.

##Chrome

- navigate to the __extensions__ screen
- ensure that __developer mode__ is checked
- select __load unpacked extensions__
- navigate to wherever you cloned this repo
- click __ok__
- enjoy no more t.co redirects

##Firefox

- install Greasemonkey
- add __greasemonkey.js__ to your userscripts

##Safari
- install t.co-bypass.safariextz

##Internet Explorer
- Anyone want to build this?
- IE7Pro works with the script - reported by @nhantrn

#GitTip

I'm listed last, I encourage you to give to all the folks in the list - they've all contributed in some way shape or form.  There are others but they don't have a gittip (if you contributed and you do have gittip, submit another PR and I'll pull it in!).
