#t.co bypass for Greasemonkey & Chrome

Fairly self explanatory, but just in case, this package will replace t.co URLs on Twitter and Tweetdeck by using other attributes in the anchor tag.

##Chrome

- navigate to the __extensions__ screen
- ensure that __developer mode__ is checked
- select __load unpacked extensions__
- navigate to wherever you cloned this repo
- click __ok__
- enjoy no more t.co redirects

##Firefox

- install [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/), [Scriptish](http://scriptish.org/), or [dotjs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dotjs/)
- add __greasemonkey.user.js__ to your userscripts

##Safari
- install t.co-bypass.safariextz

##Internet Explorer
- Anyone want to build this?
- IE7Pro works with the script - reported by @nhantrn
